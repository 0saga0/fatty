FaTTY
-----

FaTTY is the [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com) Terminal emulator with tabs. It is
useful for Windows and Cygwin users who want powerful terminal.

FaTTY is based on [mintty](https://github.com/mintty/mintty). The main
difference to mintty is that you can run multiple session in single window
using tabs.

* Most features from mintty should work
* To create new tab, press ctrl-shift-T
* To change active tab, click it with mouse or press shift-(left arrow|right arrow)
* To move tab, press ctrl-shift-(arrow direction)

If you find bugs (there are probably many), you may report them on Github or
send pull requests
